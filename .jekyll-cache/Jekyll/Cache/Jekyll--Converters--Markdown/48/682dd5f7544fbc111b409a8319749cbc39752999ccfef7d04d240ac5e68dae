<p><a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/line_graph.html">Line Graphs</a> are used to display quantitative values over a continuous interval or time period. A Line Graph is most frequently used to show trends and analyze how the data has changed over time.</p>

<p>Line Graphs are drawn by first plotting data points on a Cartesian coordinate grid, then connecting a line between all of these points. Typically, the y-axis has a quantitative value, while the x-axis is a timescale or a sequence of intervals. Negative values can be displayed below the x-axis.</p>

<p>The direction of the lines on the graph works as a nice metaphor for the data: an upward slope indicates where values have increased and a downward slope indicates where values have decreased. The lineâ€™s journey across the graph can create patterns that reveal trends in a dataset.</p>

<p>Heatmaps visualise data through variations in colouring. When applied to a tabular format, Heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the rows and columns and colouring the cells within the table. Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist in-between them.</p>

<p>Typically, all the rows are one category (labels displayed on the left or right side) and all the columns are another category (labels displayed on the top or bottom). The individual rows and columns are divided into the subcategories, which all match up with each other in a matrix. The cells contained within the table either contain colour-coded categorical data or numerical data, that is based on a colour scale. The data contained within a cell is based on the relationship between the two variables in the connecting row and column.</p>
