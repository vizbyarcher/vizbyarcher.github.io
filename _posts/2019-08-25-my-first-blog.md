Now I can start writing about something.

Let's paste in an image.
![some screenshot](/assets/images/Capture6.PNG)

HTML source code

```html
<img src="2019-08-24-21-23-57.png" width=" 450" height=" 300" />
```

This should be a very very very long paragraph in order to test paragraph reflowing and warp text settings for both desktop and mobile versions of the same page.

Code block with line numbering

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require("./lang/.............................................../" + l);
  return true;
};
{% endhighlight %}

Code block without line numbering

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

Table Example

head1 | head two | three
-------|-----------|------
ok | good fried fish | nice
out of stock | good and plenty | nice
ok | good biscuits | hmm
ok | good soup drop | yummy
